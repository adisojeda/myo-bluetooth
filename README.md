This project contains the BLE specification for the Myo armband, in the form of a C++ header file. 

**Warning** - This specification contains several new features not contained in the Myo SDKs. However, it also omits 
features that may permanently change the Myo in a not easily-reversible fashion. Please exercise caution when 
using BLE services directly.
